<h1 class="header two">Spaghetti</h1>
<img src="../images/spaghetti.jpg" alt="spaghetti" class="image spaghetti">

<p>This recipe was given to me as part of a wedding gift recipe collection from a very dear friend. It is rich, aromatic, flavorful and makes A LOT. So please grab the biggest pot you can find. I mean REALLY BIG. Extra sauce freezes well for future pasta dishes.</p>


<h2 class="sub-head one">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li> ½ cup butter</li>

    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>    
    
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    
    <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    
    <li>1 pound mild sausage</li>
    
    <li>4 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    
    <li>2 teaspoons salt (Optional)</li>
    
    <li>2 teaspoons dried rosemary</li>
    
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    
    <li>76 fluid ounces water</li>
    
    <li>1 (29 ounce) can tomato puree</li>
    
    <li>3 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>



</ul>

<h2 class="sub-head two">Steps</h2>
